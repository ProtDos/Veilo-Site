Resolving disputes.

You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.

Our Terms cover the entire agreement between you and Signal regarding our Services. If you do not agree with our Terms, you should stop using our Services.
</p><p>
If we fail to enforce any of our Terms, that does not mean we waive the right to enforce them. If any provision of the Terms is deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from our Terms and shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions. Our Services are not intended for distribution to or use in any country where such distribution or use would violate local law or would subject us to any regulations in another country. We reserve the right to limit our Services in any country. If you have specific questions about these Terms, please contact us at privacy@signal.org.</p>
